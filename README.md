# Christmas Tree Ornament
I made these Christmas tree ornaments for friends and coworkers. KiCad PCB files and Source Code included.

Right now all the ornament does is flash the lights in a line, then a defined pattern. Nothing special.

LEDs are hooked up to PA0-7 and PB0.

The code is pretty self explanitory with the comments in there.

I used 1 gold LED on the top of the tree, and the rest green and red alternating across the tree. 


Future design improvements:

Adding a small power switch! Currently you have to remove the battery or wedge a piece of card stock between the battery holder and battery to turn it off.
